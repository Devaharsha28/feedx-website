# FEEDX — Concept Summary

FEEDX is a student-led community built to help Polytechnic learners grow through Skills, Opportunities, and Knowledge (SOK). It organizes useful information, connects students with support, and makes progress easy to track.

## Mission
Make student support and growth easier to access, faster to coordinate, and transparent to track.

## The SOK Model
- **S — Skills:** Training, certifications, freelancing, and hands‑on projects to become job‑ready.
- **O — Opportunities:** Jobs, startups, internships, industrial visits, and exposure to real‑world work.
- **K — Knowledge:** Notes, resources, workshops, and feedback sharing to learn continuously.

- Curated resources (notes, question papers, guides, tools) mapped to student needs
- Updates, events, workshops, and placement‑oriented guidance
